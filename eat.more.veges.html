		Eating more vegatables is really healthy for you! 
		I know it seems disgusting and I'm sounding like your parents but it's true. 
		These are some benefits of eating vegetables. Vegetables are fat-free and cholesterol-free. 
		All vegetables by definition are cholesterol-free and for all practical purposes, fat-free. 
		Over 95 percent of vegetables contain less than a gram of fat per serving, and even that insignificant gram is mostly unsaturated fats.

		The fats in vegetables are healthy fats. 
		Vegetables are nutrient dense. Vegetables pack a lot of nutrition into a minimum of calories.
		For a measly 35 calories (the amount in one little teaspoon of butter ; Which is less calories than the butter you use when you eat pancakes), you can get a half cup of vegetables that contains a wide variety of vitamins, minerals, and health-building substances, called phytonutrients â€“ not to mention a lot of flavor. 
		Load up on legumes (the family of beans, peas, and lentils). 
		Legumes are the best plant source of proteins, fiber, and iron, in addition to being high in folic acid.
